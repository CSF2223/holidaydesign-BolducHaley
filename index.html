            <h1>Christmas</h1>
            <p>When you’re talking about December holidays, you can’t forget Christmas. Christmas is an annual festival commemorating 
            the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people 
            around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast 
            and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. 
            Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally 
            by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it. The traditional Christmas narrative 
            recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic 
            prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child 
            was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.
            
            Enormously popular in many places, Christmas involves a host of different traditions in the many countries where it’s celebrated. For example: 
            In Mexico, the celebration of Las Posadas from December 16 to December 24 honors Mary and Joseph’s search for an inn. Every night, families go 
            to a different home and ask for shelter. Once they’re let in, they celebrate together! In India, people attend special midnight masses and make 
            kheer, a sweet pudding, for neighbors and family. Norwegians celebrate with their own kind of rice pudding, called riskrem, on Christmas Eve. 
            Brazilian children leave a sock near the window for Bom Velhinho (a Brazilian name for Santa Claus). If he finds it, they get a present! In Ireland, 
            some people take a cold swim in the ocean on Christmas morning!</p>

            <h1>Hanukkah</h1>
            <p>Every year, Jewish families around the world gather to celebrate Hanukkah. 
            The holiday commemorates the miraculous longevity of a small quantity of oil that 
            kept the menorah in the Second Temple in Jerusalem lit after it was reclaimed from 
            invaders during an ancient battle. Though there was only enough oil to last for one 
            day, it stayed lit for eight.
            
            In remembrance, Jews worldwide light menorahs for eight days every Hanukkah to celebrate. 
            Families give gifts, play games of dreidel, and enjoy special foods all over the world: sufganiyot 
            jelly donuts in Israel, latke potato pancakes in Eastern Europe, fried plantain patacones in Colombia, 
            and more! </p>

            <h1>Kwanza</h1>
            <p>Kwanzaa, a weeklong celebration of community and African culture, began with African Americans in the 
            United States. Known for its seven principles of unity (umoja), collective work and responsibility (ujima), 
            cooperative economics (ujamaa), self-determination (kujichagulia), purpose (nia), creativity (kuumba), and faith 
            (imani), the holiday also places special significance on children.

            Because children are the future of the community, they’re honored during Kwanzaa with gifts and encouraged to take 
            important roles in celebrations. They even helped give the holiday its name—Kwanzaa’s founders added an extra a to the 
            Kiswahili word kwanza because seven children were involved in the celebration’s early years!</p>
